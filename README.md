# Cianuro y zombies
By Stephen W. Martin

## Why?
I inspired myself to write this by reading the work of [Julián Merelo](https://github.com/JJ/hoborg). I think doing creative writing on GitHub is an excellent idea, because you can keep track of every change you make, it kinda forces you to have a local backup, and, for that matter backing up regularly.
Besides, I read this one story ([Benjamin-Buckingham-And-The-Nightmares-Nightmare-Nove](https://github.com/gregorygershwin/Benjamin-Buckingham-And-The-Nightmares-Nightmare-Novel/tree/master/initial-drafts)), that is another great piece of creative writing using GitHub. I think there is something great about showing people your creative process, because, not a single book in history of literature has just had been published straight of the mind of the writer. Books always need to be changed in some way, as writing is an iterativem process.



## How can I read it?
You can go ahead and read it [here](https://github.com/stephenwmartin/cyz-by--sm/tree/master/epub-sample/build/md/cz.md).

### But it's in spanish
Yep, thats my mother tongue, but as a TODO definetely is a translation to many languages, although I'm just starting with this one.

### How to create the epub file
I'm using Pandoc to achieve this, you can use the command:
```shell
make  

```
Which will create epub, html and md files.

`metadata.txt`: Contains the info about the title, author, license, etc. This is not visible to the reader, this, as the title suggests is merely metadata.
